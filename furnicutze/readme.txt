"Furnicutze" is a game I implemented based on a real puzzle; You cannot try to solve it, it is not interactive, but it represents a combination bettween javascript, games and programming techniques (backtracking). The upper array represents the array of cards (the cards with green border are still available to be used; the other ones are red-borded and cannot be used, they are already on the board). 
The lower array represents the backtracking stack.
The purpose of this game (the original puzzle) is to create a 3*3 sqare using the 9 cards (you can rotate the anyway you want), such that the final 3*3 square shoud be a continuus image (the images on each side of the small asquares should match). There is no quarantee that the game has only one solution (in fact it doesn't; this example has two), but it will only display the first one (even if the algorithm is able to print them all).
